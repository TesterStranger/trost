Trost
=====

Trost is a simple blogging platform built with Node.js. It is designed to be simple and easy to use
for both the reader and the author. With theme and plugin support it can be customized to fit your
ever changing needs.

Trost is heavily inspiried by other open source projects like 
- [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) (Inspiration for the project)
- [NodeBB](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB) (We use their plugin implementation!)
- [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) (They have some pretty awesome search ;) )
